# Weather-App
## Building a weather app offers a practical and rewarding way to apply your web development skills. By working on this project, you'll gain valuable experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as familiarity with fetching data from external APIs. Plus, you'll create a useful tool that provides real-time weather information to users.

##In this blog post, I'll walk you through the process of building a weather app from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
